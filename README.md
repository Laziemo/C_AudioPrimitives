# C_AudioPrimitives
CMD-Line Audio Tools

A bunch of primitive audio tools for you to implement in your own programs. 
All work done in conjunction with The Audio Programming Book (APB) by Richard Boulanger, Richard Dobson and Victor Lazzarini.
Special thanks to Max Matthews & Miller Puckette. 
We are standing on the shoulders of giants!

All code presented here are variations of code found in the APB text.
Feel free to take the code and do with it as you please.
